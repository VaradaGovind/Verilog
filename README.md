# Verilog
A curated collection of Verilog HDL projects demonstrating digital design fundamentals, including combinational and sequential circuits, memory modules, finite state machines (FSMs), and processor components. Each project is accompanied by clean, well-documented code and corresponding testbenches for simulation and verification.
